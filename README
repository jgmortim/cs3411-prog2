Everything Works! Unless you want more than 1023 players.
1024 or more players creates a pipe error.
Valgrind reports no errors or memory leaks.

Error handling (exit with no leaks) for:
	incorrect input (usage)
	dup2()
	execv()
	fork()
	pipe()

No/minimal error handling for:
	free()
	malloc()
	read()
	sprintf()
	write()

Also, I discovered that if you accidentially send SIGTERM to a process twice,
the lab computers force logout without properly closing any of the
applications you have running.
